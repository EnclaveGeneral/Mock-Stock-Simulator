Known Issues:
  Lack of a cohesive, comprehensive user dashboard for operations, as it is still working in
  progress, no known bugs at the time.

AI Use:
  Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5 for generating a few of the UI elements in material UI due to time
  constraint, almost all logic functions and modules are hand programmed by me

Personal Reflection:
  This project is one of the most comprehensive project on the web i have worked on, it has hammered my program abilities in React, helping me to learn so many different functions, such as OutletContext, UseMemoization, UseEffect, Navigator, as well as deepended my understanding
  on quite a few React specific syntax, the best example being for [] objects, we do not
  want to modify them as they are considered immutable in React, but they are considered mutable
  in plain javascript. These things which are kind of obscure unless you work on it is things
  I have learned greatly though this project. In addition, while attemping to figure out a solution for my API Key, I was drawn into the rabbit hole of using complete cloud end API
  server hosting, as in my entire API is hosted on the cloud itself, and the information from
  API is triggered through a lambda function, which then passes the necessary and relevant
  information back to the client.This gave me much deeper insight into the AWS ecosystems

Additional Information:
  I would like to keep working on this project even after this class, as I am an active trader
  participating in the market, and so is my family and my parents. This is something that
  we coudl all seriously use for sure.
